# opinionated-express-mvc [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Scaffolding for building an Express API

## Description

Sets up an Express API configured for use with Postgres database through bookshelf and knex. Includes two resources with restful route configuraiton and associations.

_This generator assumes user has postgres installed and running on your machine._

## Installation

### Global Install

To install globally, simply run:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-opinionated-express-mvc
```

### Local Install

If you don't have permissions to install packages globally follow the following steps

```bash
$ mkdir <your-app-name>
$ cd <your-app-name>
$ yarn init -y
$ yarn add yo
$ yarn add https://github.com/shanebarringer/generator-opinionated-express-mvc.git
```

## Setup

To generate your new project run:

##### global

```bash
$ yo opinionated-express-mvc
```

##### local

```bash
$ yarn yo opinionated-express-mvc
```

_note: this generator creates a directory for your project. If you've run the local install option, your project will be nested in a new directory. To fix this issue, `mv` the entire directory up one level by running `$ mv <your-app-name>/* ./ && mv <your-app-name>/.* ./`_

Once the install/setup is complete, you'll be able to run the server and view the available resources at `http://localhost:3001`. Once satisfied, run the cleanup script.

```bash
$ yarn cleanup
```

This command will leave the directory structure intact, while removing the existing models, migrations, seeds, routes, etc.
